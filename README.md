# Bitcoin prices and search interest in Google

## Abstract  

Almost one year ago Bitcoin prices peaked at 20.000$ and from today's perspective it's easy to visualize the bubble around cryptocurrencies. However, from an economic point of view and specially for those who like behavioral finance, I found an interesting correlation between Bitcoin prices and the search interest on “Bitcoin” in Google around the world for the last 2 years. I got the Search interest data from Google Trends and it can be a very interesting relation to study when analyzing massive trends on financial assets or any other sentiment analysis.
